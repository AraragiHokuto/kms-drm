### Known bugs
- i915 is leaking memory (gem objects).
- DMC & HuC firmware loading seem fine but GuC loading sometimes fails but it is also disabled by default in Linux so might be upstream error.  
Enable by adding to your /boot/loader.conf  
compat.linuxkpi.enable_guc_submission=2  
compat.linuxkpi.enable_guc_loading=2
- ???
